# Assignment 04 - React Hooks

## Assignment Brief
> **Create the following custom hooks, and an app that shows off their usage:**
> 1. A “**usePrevious**” hook that takes a piece of state, and returns whatever that state was on the previous render.
> 
> 2. A “**useDebouncedState**” hook that takes an initial value and a debounce time in ms. It should return a [state, setState] array, but the state value should be debounced by the time specified.
> 
> 3. A "**useTypewriter**" hook that takes a string and a delay in ms, and returns that string typed out with the given delay between each letter. For example, if the input string is "test" and the delay is 100ms, then after 100ms the return value should be "t", after 200ms the return value should be "te", after 300ms the return value should be "tes", and from 400ms onward the return value should be "test". The typewriter effect should start when the component first renders, and it should restart whenever the input string changes.
